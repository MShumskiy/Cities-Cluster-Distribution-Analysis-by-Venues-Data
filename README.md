# Cities-Cluster-Distribution-Analysis-by-Venues-Data
The Jupyter notebook is fully documented and every step is explained, I suggest using nbviewer to view it:  
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ and insert this link https://github.com/MShumskiy/Cities-Cluster-Distribution-Analysis-by-Venues-Data/blob/master/Cities%20Cluster%20Distribution%20Analysis%20by%20Venues%20Data.ipynb  
Once this is done you can view the notebook fully documented and with visible results.
